# Advent of Code

These are my solutions for the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) in go. I'm not a go developer, I did the advent to learn go, so don't expect good code. Some of the solutions are inspired by the ones from the [Advent of Code subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), but I tried to do all of it myself. 

There are different branches for the differnt years, the current year is the default branch. 

## Usage

There is a folder for each day. The input file is the *.in file, the examples to test are in the *.ex files. 

To run the code, you need to have go installed. Then you can run the code with `go run <dayNumber>.go` in the day's folder.

To run the code for part 1, you have to checkout the right commit because part 2 is added on top and edits the code for part 1.
